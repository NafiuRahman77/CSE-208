## Contents

### Offline-1: Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)
- **Description**: Implements Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms to find the minimum spanning tree of a graph.

### Offline-2: Single-Source Shortest Path (Dijkstra's Algorithm)
- **Description**: Implements Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the shortest path from a single source node to all other nodes in a graph.

### Offline-3: All-Pairs Shortest Path (Floyd-Warshall Algorithm)
- **Description**: Implements the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to compute shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in a graph.

### Offline-4: Max Flow (Baseball Elimination Problem)
- **Description**: Solves the Baseball Elimination problem using the Max Flow algorithm.

### Offline-5: Fibonacci Heap
- **Description**: Implements the Fibonacci Heap data structure, commonly used for priority queues and Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm optimizations.

### Offline-6: Red-Black Tree
- **Description**: Implements a Red-Black Tree data structure with insertion and balancing operations.

### Offline-7: Hashing
- **Description**: Implements the following hashing techniques:
1. **Separate Chaining**:  
   - Uses linked lists to resolve collisions in hash tables.

2. **Linear Probing**:  
   - Resolves collisions using a linear probing hash function:  
     ```
     h(k, i) = (h1(k) + i) mod N
     ```

3. **Quadratic Probing**:  
   - Resolves collisions using a quadratic probing hash function:  
     ```
     h(k, i) = (h1(k) + c1 * i + c2 * i^2) mod N
     ```
     - Where `c1` and `c2` are positive constants.

4. **Double Hashing**:  
   - Resolves collisions using a double hashing function:  
     ```
     h(k, i) = (h1(k) + i * h2(k)) mod N
     ```
